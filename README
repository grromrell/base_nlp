This package is currently pre-release and under development. The goal of this 
package is to be a more experimental Natural Language Processing module. The 
current options are basically limited to NLTK, scikit-learn and gensim. NLTK 
is meant as a teaching tool and scikit learn only implements tokenization and
tfidf, while gensim is specifically focused on topic modelling. It seems there 
is a niche for a more advanced tool that attempts to implement the "state of the
art" tools. Before we get there we must first cover the basics that are already
implemented elsewhere. This is the current stage of development. Moving forward
the focus will be on more advanced tools.
